Hi !

1) I found complicated in TP2 was to understand what we really wanted to code and concepts but json to C# websites really helped and at the end it went ok.
2) The SOLID principles is an object-oriented programming : 
S: Single Responsibility Principle
O: Open closed Principle 
L: Liskov substitution Principle 
I: Interface Segregation Principle
D: Dependency Inversion Principle 

KISS : "Keep it simple, stupid"

Boy scout rule : 
'Always leave the code better than you found it.'
To avoid software degradation.

Clean architecture helps understanding the "big picture" of the project.

Clean code can be modified by someone that never worked on the project, he can understand what you wanted to do and try to make it better.
Uses variables names that are logical for exemple : Wordpress isn't quality code.

3) I didn't manage to make the graphical interface
